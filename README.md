#till now I have collected my raw reads (fastq file)
#next download a genome file (reference genome)entire genome 
#next get the GTF file also as it has information related to  annotation telling that from this base pair to this base pair its gene A chr 1 ,and from this base pair to this base pair it is gene B chr1 



#where to genome file and gtf file 

#1.	Got o ensemble browser
#2.	Click on all genome select the organism.
#3.	In gene annotation section on the right side you wil get gtf file.
#4.	For genome file download fasta in the section.
#5.	Click on dna folder
#6.	Next look for toplevel.fasta file to get the entire genome of the organism


#After all this I have mentioned everything in my R script.
